Finally got around to fixing the water autotiles. The water tiles in "water_updated.png" are 16x16 tiles. 

Now they'll be easier to work with.

The ones in the original "water.png" are made up of 8x8 "autotile chunks" formatted to work with RPGMaker.

Note: "inside_ceilingborders_updated.png" is from a previous update and it corrects the same problem for some tiles in "inside.png".
